# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Scholarship Platform is a full-stack web application that helps students discover and match with relevant scholarship opportunities. The platform provides two primary entry paths: CV upload for automated profile extraction or guided questionnaire for manual profile creation. The system ingests scholarship data from multiple sources, normalizes and enriches it, then uses intelligent matching algorithms to present personalized results to users. The platform features a modern orange/brown themed UI with real-time search capabilities, admin management tools, and optional premium features.
